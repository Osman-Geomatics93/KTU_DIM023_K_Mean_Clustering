ðŸŽ¨ Image Processing Toolkit

An advanced, GUI-driven image processing application, crafted using tkinter, designed to empower users with a suite of tools to analyze and transform both grayscale and color images.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:

**Summary:**

We've developed a GUI-based Python application utilizing the Tkinter library, designed for comprehensive image processing tasks. This tool empowers users to implement k-means clustering, a potent machine learning technique for image segmentation and pattern recognition, on various image formats including .jpg, .jpeg, .png, and more. Once an image is uploaded, users can view its original or grayscale version and then apply k-means clustering to discern specific features or patterns in both color and grayscale modes. Additional functionalities include visualizing pixel intensity distributions through histograms, pinpointing k-means cluster centers, and generating scatter plots for color bands. This intuitive application streamlines the otherwise complex process of image segmentation, making advanced image analysis accessible even to non-experts.

ðŸ›  Built With:

PIL: For comprehensive image handling and operations.
numpy: Powers numerical computations, ensuring efficient matrix operations.
matplotlib: The backbone for all plotting functionalities.
sklearn: Drives the K-means clustering algorithm, optimizing for precise segmentations.
ðŸ“¥ Get Started:
Simply clone the repository, ensure you have the required libraries installed, and run the main script to launch the GUI.
