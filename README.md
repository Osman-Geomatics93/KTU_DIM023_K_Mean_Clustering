ðŸŽ¨ Image Processing Toolkit

An advanced, GUI-driven image processing application, crafted using tkinter, designed to empower users with a suite of tools to analyze and transform both grayscale and color images.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:

Versatile Image Loading: Seamlessly import standard formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF) and specialized .img raster files.
Dynamic Image Display: Instantly view the original, grayscale, and K-means clustered renditions of your chosen image.
Histogram Insights: Dive deep into color and grayscale image histograms, with added visualization of K-means clustering centers.
K-means Clustering: Segment grayscale and color images using K-means clustering. Customize the number of clusters for tailored results.
Visual Analytics: Plot K-means center intensities for grayscale images and explore RGB band relationships with an interactive scatter plot.

ðŸ›  Built With:

PIL: For comprehensive image handling and operations.
numpy: Powers numerical computations, ensuring efficient matrix operations.
matplotlib: The backbone for all plotting functionalities.
sklearn: Drives the K-means clustering algorithm, optimizing for precise segmentations.
ðŸ“¥ Get Started:
Simply clone the repository, ensure you have the required libraries installed, and run the main script to launch the GUI.
